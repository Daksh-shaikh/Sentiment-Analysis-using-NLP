Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP

This project is aimed at analyzing the sentiment of tweets using Natural Language Processing techniques. The project involves two columns named 'tweet' and 'sentiment'.

The 'tweet' column contains a list of tweets collected from various sources, while the 'sentiment' column contains the sentiment of each tweet, 
which can either be 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral' or 'Can't tell'.

Dataset :
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of tweets obtained from various sources. The dataset contains a total of 7274 tweets, 
with each tweet labeled as either 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral' or 'Can't tell'.

Preprocessing : 
Before we can feed the text data into the model, we need to preprocess it. This involves several steps, such as:

Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words
Stop word removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to the meaning of the text
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form

Evaluation :
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Conclusion :
Sentiment analysis is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing, and there are various approaches to tackle it.
The performance of the model can be improved by using more advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms and transfer learning.
